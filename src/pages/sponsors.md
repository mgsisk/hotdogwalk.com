  Help us fight hunger in Kalamazoo by becoming a Kalamazoo Hot Dog Walk sponsor!
---

This may be the easiest way to sponsor an event ever! Your entire donation goes
**directly** to Kalamazoo Loaves and Fishes and is tax deductible. In turn, we
recognize you to our registrants as a proud partner. Your donation will help to
fight hunger in our community. Interested in sponsoring?

There are two ways that you can make the payment for the donation. The first is
just by a check made out to **Kalamazoo Loaves & Fishes** and write "Hot Dog
Walk" in the memo line. That can be mailed in or given to us at the event--most
sponsors, if they are using a paper check, just opt to give it to us at the
event.

The other way is to donate online at <http://klf.convio.net/donate>. When
prompted, just write "Kalamazoo Hot Dog Walk" in the comment box.

If you pay with a paper check, Kalamazoo Loaves & Fishes will issue you a
receipt for tax purposes. If you do the online donation it will be emailed
directly to you.
